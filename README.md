# Flasher
Primary aim is to incrementally support different mediatek devices based on data dumps from users of this program.
I've written it mostly as a PoC initally since SP Flashtool is using proprietary library to do interesting bits.

When more SoCs will be supported, code structure is going to improve because I just need it to work at first.
Feel free to issue pull requests when code looks too ugly or have some interesting ideas.

Support in progress for following devices:
* MT6735P
